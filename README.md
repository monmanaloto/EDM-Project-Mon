## About me
Hi my name is Mon Alexis Manaloto, a first-year BSIS student at City College of Angeles. Coding is my thing, and I’m always experimenting with new programming languages to level up my skills. When I’m not in front of a screen, you can usually find me catching a basketball game, staying updated on the latest news, or just enjoying the sport in general.
